# worlds
A ROS package simply to contain gazebo world files

Can run, e.g.:
`roslaunch worlds empty_world.launch`
or:
`roslaunch worlds play_pen_world.launch`  (brings up starting_pen, cafe table, beer can)
Can then insert robots, cameras, etc, as desired.

New, 2/19/19: auto-launch Fetch robot as well (not yet in correct location)
`roslaunch worlds Fetch_kit.launch`
