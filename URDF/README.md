Here is a simulated workspace for Fetch robot. The Fetch.stl file is in .zip since it was too large to upload on to github, so to use it please unzip it after clone the contents.

Please copy and paste the davinci_table from exmple_models to .gazebo. .gazebo can be found at your home repository by typing ctrl + h. After that, the davinci table can be launched from models. (recent add)

To launch the workspace, simply type `roslaunch worlds Fetch_kit.launch`.
Make sure to use Gazebo 9 and melodic since thats the requirements for the competition.
