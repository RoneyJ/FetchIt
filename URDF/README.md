Here is a simulated workspace for Fetch robot. The Fetch.stl file is in .zip since it was too large to upload on to github, so to use it please unzip it after clone the contents.

To launch the workspace, simply type `roslaunch worlds Fetch_kit.launch`.
Make sure to use Gazebo 9 and melodic since thats the requirements for the competition.

I'll further make changes as well. So please be aware of new commits.
