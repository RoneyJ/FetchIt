Fetch to-do:

1) bag data w/ robot spin in place, starting from odom = 0, robot centered in arena, facing Shunck machine

2) do new arm move tests...slower, more carefully

3) do K_phi lin-steering feedback tests;
    command motion

from start, move forward 1m; turn 180 (CCW); 
   repeat: 
      move forward 2 m; turn 180 (CW); 
      move forward 2m; turn 180 (CCW);

equiv,
 waypoint (1,0)->(-1,0)->(1,0) repeat

edits: 

run nodes:
roslaunch test_back_and_forth_w_odom_feedback.launch

want to change gains in: /lin_steering/steering_algorithm.h
const double K_PHI= 10.0; // control gains for steering
const double K_DISP = 6.0;
const double K_TRIP_DIST = 3.0;
